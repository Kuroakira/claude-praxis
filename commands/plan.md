Invoke the skill `getting-started` and begin the **Planning Phase**:

1. Read the Design Doc
2. Break it into small PRs / phases
3. For each task, specify:
   - Exact file paths to create or modify
   - What tests to write (TDD — test first)
   - Verification steps
   - Dependencies on other tasks
4. Each task should be completable in 2-5 minutes
5. Save the plan for reference during execution
